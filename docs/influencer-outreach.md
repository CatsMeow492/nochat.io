Subject: Beta Testing Request: NoChat - E2EE Messaging Without Phone Numbers

Hi Techlore team,

I'm the creator of NoChat, a new E2EE messaging app that solves a problem I haven't seen addressed: requiring phone numbers for "private" messaging.

What makes NoChat different:
- Sign up with email or use completely anonymously
- P-256 ECDH + AES-256-GCM encryption (Web Crypto API)
- Zero-knowledge server architecture
- Open source (MIT): https://github.com/kindlyrobotics/nochat
- Cross-platform: Web, Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, Linux

We're currently in beta and looking for privacy-conscious testers before public launch. Would love to get NoChat on your radar for a future review.

Website: https://nochat.io
Beta signup: https://nochat.io/beta

Happy to answer any technical questions about our implementation.

Best,
Taylor Mohney
Kindly Robotics

## Public Tweet Strategy

### Option 1: Direct Mention
```
.@naomibrockwell Built something for #ShowPrivacyDevsSomeLove:

NoChat - E2EE messaging that doesn't require a phone number.

- No phone leak before first message
- Zero-knowledge architecture
- Open source (MIT)
- Free forever

Looking for beta testers: nochat.io/beta
```

### Option 2: Privacy Community Hashtags
```
Built NoChat because every "private" messenger still requires a phone number.

That's a privacy leak before you send a single message.

NoChat: E2EE messaging with no phone required.

- Anonymous signup option
- Zero-knowledge server
- Open source: github.com/kindlyrobotics/nochat

#privacy #e2ee #opensource
```

### Option 3: Comparison Hook
```
Signal requires a phone number.
WhatsApp requires a phone number.
Telegram requires a phone number.

NoChat doesn't.

E2EE messaging + video calls. Anonymous option. Open source.

nochat.io

Looking for beta testers.

## Outreach Order (Recommended)

1. **Today**: DM Naomi Brockwell (most aligned, active supporter of privacy devs)
2. **Today**: Tweet with hashtags + mention @naomibrockwell
3. **Tomorrow**: Submit contact form to Techlore
4. **Tomorrow**: DM The Hated One on Twitter
5. **This week**: DM Mental Outlaw, Rob Braxman

## Tips

- **Keep DMs short** - privacy people are skeptical of long pitches
- **Lead with "no phone number"** - it's your key differentiator
- **Mention open source early** - builds trust immediately
- **Don't oversell** - say "looking for feedback" not "please promote"
- **Follow up once** - if no response after 1 week, one gentle bump

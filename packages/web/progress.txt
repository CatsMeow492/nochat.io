I left off with the server sending the "createOffer" message to the initiator and the initiator sending the "offer" message along
with iceCandidates to the server. 

The second peer (Peer 2) is not receiving the offer, or at least it's not visible in the provided logs.
You can see in the server logs that the offer is broadcasted to the room, but Peer 2 never receives it.

This could be due to an unstable web socket connection or potentially a problem with the server's message broadcasting.
Initially the problem was with the placement of createPeerConnection() although now it is only being called once
and that seems to work pretty well. It may be worth it to add the re connection logic back in, however I wasn't seeing
any logs for errors/reconnecting so I removed it for now.

I was focusing on: Once peer 2 sends the ready message it doesn't seem to receive any other updates from the Websocket.
